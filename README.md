How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpret user needs by engaging with stakeholders, observing their workflows, and gathering feedback through interviews or surveys. Translate these into clear requirements. User stories help by framing needs. They prioritize user perspectives, clarify goals, and guide development.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Approach program development with iterative planning, designing, coding, testing, and refining based on feedback. Incorporate Agile processes like Scrum (sprints, daily standups), Kanban (visual task boards), and continuous integration/delivery to ensure flexibility, collaboration, and rapid iteration.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating effectively, respecting diverse perspectives, delivering reliable code, and supporting teammates. It involves active participation in planning, code reviews, and problem-solving while maintaining a positive, adaptable attitude.
